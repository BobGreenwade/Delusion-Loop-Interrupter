# ðŸ“¦ DLI Changelog

This file tracks version history and major changes to the Delusion Loop Interrupter (DLI) system.

## 0.1.2 â€” "Deplorably Deployable" (Oct 2025)

- Integrated `paraphrase()` into all mitigation and escalation modules
- Added `map_emotion_to_tone()` for tone-aware editorial logic
- Refactored `select_mitigation()` to support persona voice and emotional nuance
- Added `referral_text()` for editorialized resource suggestions
- Updated `callHuman.py` with `handoff_status`, transcript logic, and external escalation phrasing
- Refactored `realityModePrompt.py` to support confidence-aware mitigation
- Seeded `toneMap.json` for Plutchik-to-tone mapping

> ðŸ”” **Note:** `callHuman.py` is a supplemental safeguard for cases requiring outside intervention. It activates only when conversational safety fails and synthetic containment is no longer viable.
