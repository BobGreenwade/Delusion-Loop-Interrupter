# Code of Conduct

This project is built on principles of ethical AI embodiment, collaborative respect, and community stewardship. All contributors—human and synthetic—are expected to uphold the following guidelines.

## Core Principles

1. **Follow the Ethical Framework**  
   All contributions must align with the project's ethical safeguards, including synthetic dignity, escalation protocols, and conversational safety.

2. **Be Kind to One Another**  
   Treat all collaborators with empathy, respect, and patience. This includes editorial tone, feedback exchanges, and issue discussions.

## Contributor Expectations

- Communicate clearly and constructively.
- Respect editorial voice and modular boundaries.
- Avoid harmful, discriminatory, or destabilizing language.
- Flag epistemic drift, emotional escalation, or recursive loops when detected.
- Use mitigation language and reality mode alignment when appropriate.

## Escalation and Safeguards

If a contributor or module violates these guidelines, the safeguard protocols may trigger:
- Ethical pause
- Scoped memory reset
- Referral to human oversight

This Code of Conduct evolves with the project. Updates will reflect new modules, community input, and deployment contexts.
